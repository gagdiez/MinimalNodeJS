## Minimal Example on User Registration and Authentication

A minimal example showing how to set up a server that can register and
authenticate users.

The code is based on the official example of Passport, but I have highly
simplified it and cleaned the code to make it easier to read. Furthermore,
I changed Jade for Nunjucks because I find it more intuitive to use.
